This portfolio highlights my internship experience and research work conducted while attending Bucknell University.

## Internship - Geisinger Medical Center

I worked as an intern in the research department of Geisinger Medical Center beginning in May 2020 and continuing through fall. I worked primarily for the Meyer-Chabris lab, however I was also able to work with staff scientists from the Behavioral Insights Team housed within Geisinger's Steele Institute for Health Innovation on different projects.

I assisted with the creation of a collective intelligence experiment that analyzes group performances on tasks. We are working primarily to analyze what makes a group "good", as well as to extend previous research on this subject by analyzing the effects that virtual communication level has on group performance. We restricted all group communication to virtual offerings (whereas previous studies were conducted in-person), and we varied the levels between video/audio, audio only, messaging only, and asynchronous communication.

My work throughout the summer focused on constructing this experiment, conducting multiple pilot runs, and editing the experiment based on the results with pilot groups. My current and upcoming work in the fall will focus on running the experiment with "real" participants, collecting and cleaning the data, and beginning data analysis. 



## Research: Redefining Food Access in Rural Counties of Pennsylvania

**Food access** is defined as the percent of individuals in urban census blocks living more than one mile from a major supermarket or grocery store, and the percent in rural census blocks living more than ten miles from a major supermarket or grocery store (United States Department of Agriculture).

As a Clare Boothe Luce Research Scholar, I spent 10 weeks in the summer of 2019 conducting research on food access in rural counties of Pennsylvania with Abby Flynt, Associate Professor of Mathematics at Bucknell University. Our goal was to use statistical analyses on publicly-available data to model variables that most directly affect an individual's access to food, with hopes to redefine the current definition that only accounts for physical distance from a grocery store.

As a student researcher, I gathered and cleaned a large quantity of publicly-available data, and I performed Exploratory Data Analyses and spatial hierarchical clustering analyses using R. I then mapped these analyses using the ggmap package in R. Professor Abby Flynt is continuing the research during the 2019-2020 school year.
