## Research: Redefining Food Access in Rural Counties of Pennsylvania

**Food access** is defined as the percent of individuals in urban census blocks living more than one mile from a major supermarket or grocery store, and the percent in rural census blocks living more than ten miles from a major supermarket or grocery store (United States Department of Agriculture).

As a Clare Boothe Luce Research Scholar, I spent 10 weeks in the summer of 2019 conducting research on food access in rural counties of Pennsylvania with Abby Flynt, Associate Professor of Mathematics at Bucknell University. Our goal was to use statistical analyses on publicly-available data to model variables that most directly affect an individual's access to food, with hopes to redefine the current definition that only accounts for physical distance from a grocery store.

As a student researcher, I gathered and cleaned a large quantity of publicly-available data, and I performed Exploratory Data Analyses and spatial hierarchical clustering analyses using R. I then mapped these analyses using the ggmap package in R. Professor Abby Flynt is continuing the research during the 2019-2020 school year.
